### Discription
* Phase 1: A program which will take an array of ints and sort it using a bubble sort algorithm and then a merge sort algorithm.
* Phase 2: Include JUnit tests for this and all subsequent phases (and all subsequent projects for the rest of time). I implements MVC and a basic factory pattern to determine which sorter to use. 
* Phase 3: added logging code into the Sort Manager project. Set up log4j in the project and add a properties file. 
* Phase 4: I have Integrated a new class to implement a binary search tree approach for sorting.
* Phase 5: Added timing information to the project and allow the user to select multiple algorithms to compare their performance.
